I'm a chartered scientist with decades of experience applying neural networks to remote sensing imagery - from undergraduate and doctoral studies to roles in the public sector. As an on-off environmental activist, and with increasing alarm at cavalier uses of AI, I am studying [Public Administration](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/study/master-public-administration-mpa-innovation-public-policy-and-public-value) at the [UCL Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/) to understand better how decisions are made, and if or how I can influence these. My specific interest is in the gap between science and policy, and I am very curious about the failures of rationalism in both fields.

In chronological order, having started my career in the natural sciences and moving into the formal sciences, I am now _squaring the triangle_ by studying social sciences.

Early posts in this blog are course assignments. Now that I am in the final phase of my course, I will post regular, probably scrappy, updates on my changing understanding and thinking.

You can also find public copies of my other assignments (after marking) on economics, innovation, democracy and AI in [this repository](https://github.com/PenguinJunk/mpa-assignments).
