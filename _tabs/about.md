I'm a chartered scientist with decades of experience applying neural networks to remote sensing imagery - from undergraduate and doctoral studies to roles in the public sector. As an on-off environmental activist, and with increasing alarm at cavalier uses of AI. Most recently, I've spent time at counter-protests outside asylum hotels and on marches opposing the rising fascist movement that we are now experiencing first-hand in our city.

I currently consider myself a "gigging researcher" somewhere along a "pivot" roughly out of technology and into social science. This pivot started when I studied [Public Administration](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/study/master-public-administration-mpa-innovation-public-policy-and-public-value) at the [UCL Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/) to understand better how decisions are made, and if or how I can influence these[^assign]. Now I am applying some of what I learned and learning so much more through rich and important projects led by others. My aim is to obtain funding for my own research. 

In chronological order, having started my career in the natural sciences and moving into the formal sciences, I am now _squaring the triangle_ within social sciences.
