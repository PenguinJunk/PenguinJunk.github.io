This blog was initially created as part of an assignment on my Masters course. Who knows where it will go? For now, you need know no more than that I am a student in [Public Administration](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/study/master-public-administration-mpa-innovation-public-policy-and-public-value) at the [UCL Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/), that I have more than a quarter of a century (eek!) in public sector tech research and that what ultimately drives me are environmental and social issues (often involving transport).

Putting it in chronological order, having started my career in the natural sciences and moving into the formal sciences, I am now _squaring the triangle_ by studying social sciences.
