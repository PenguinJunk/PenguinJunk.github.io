This blog was initially created as part of an assignment on my Masters course. I'm not sure where it will go.

For now, you need know no more than that I am a student in [Public Administration](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/study/master-public-administration-mpa-innovation-public-policy-and-public-value) at the [UCL Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/), that I have more than a quarter of a century (eek!) in public sector tech research and that what ultimately drives me are environmental and social issues.

Putting it in chronological order, having started my career in the natural sciences and moving into the formal sciences, I am now _squaring the triangle_ by studying social sciences.

I'm using this blog to practise working transparently in the full knowledge that just about nobody will be reading this site. You will find iterations of my first assignment and possibly rough drafts of future posts. I hope that I won't be too distracted by coursework to eventually finish these posts.

You can also find public copies of my other assignments (after marking) on economics, innovation, democracy and AI in [this repository](https://github.com/PenguinJunk/mpa-assignments).
