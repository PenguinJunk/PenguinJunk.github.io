## The Hope Coda

For decades, whenever a journalist wrote about climate change they almost always had to add a "hope coda" - the section at the end that started with "But its not all doom and gloom..." or words to that affect that would try to lighten the mood before the end of the article. The reasoning was that scaring people would incapacitate them and they would therefore not act on climate change. Or perhaps there was a concern about losing readers. Whatever, despite - or perhaps because of - the regular dose of hope, we didn't act on climate change in a timely way, and we still aren't acting with anywhere near the urgency needed. I'm using "we" loosely, I'm not going into who did or didn't act just now.

I'm noticing a similar trend in AI articles which may talk about the risks of AI to society (e.g. in the second half of [this podcast](https://scientificadvice.eu/podcast/andrea-emilio-rizzoli-and-manuel-kugler-on-ai-in-science-and-science-advice/)) or the heavy energy and water use of AI approaches that process (e.g. [this article](https://uk.pcmag.com/ai/151956/power-hungry-ai-is-eating-the-planet-is-it-also-our-best-chance-to-save-it)). This is the hope coda that "AI will help us solve climate change". I think we need to challenge these claims about AI solving climate before the repeated claim become an illusory truth (if it hasn't already). 

## How do we solve climate change?

Firstly, what are the general issues that we need to address to solve climate change? In a literal sense, there's just one issue - we need to bring greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and ocean to levels that stabilise the climate within safe limits. With this aim, the UK's Climate Change Committee divide the [6th Carbon Budget](https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/sixth-carbon-budget) into 11 main sectors that need action to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions:
1. surface transport
1. buildings
1. manufacturing and construction
1. electricity generation
1. fuel supply
1. agriculture and land use
1. aviation
1. shipping
1. waste
1. F-gases
1. greenhouse gas removals

This tell us *materially* what we need to do but there are still social and political - systemic - issues that are preventing action. [Stoddard *et al*. (2021)](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-environ-012220-011104)  looked through 9 lenses on why we haven't started reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 3 decades:
1. climate governance
1. the vested interests of the fossil fuel industry
1. geopolitics and militarism (manifest in global extractivism)
1. economics and financialization
1. mitigation modelling
1. energy supply systems
1. inequity
1. high-carbon lifestyles
1. social imaginaries

Th decomposition of the problem of climate change to both material and systemic aspects is useful for considering where any possible solution can apply.

## What can AI solve?

I would break down the applications of AI into 3 groups (but I'd be happy to hear your thoughts):
1. measure and monitor climate damage, adaptation and mitigation 
1. optimise existing products and processes
1. accelerate the development of new products and processes

### Measure and monitor climate damage, adaptation and mitigation

The most common form of hope coda is "all is not doom and gloom, we can leverage AI to detect wildfires/flooding/methane/penguins/etc." This is all very well, but it isn't really tackling any of the core material or systemic areas. Its useful to know how well or badly we are doing. However, given that generally the sensor is more important than the data processing, the processing-hungry AI approaches that are the topic of these articles are rarely justified. 

### Optimise existing products and processes

Most AI is optimisation of some sort and thus searching across a high-dimensional space for better solutions is an excellent application of these technologies. They can take the tedium out of logistics, optimising supply chains, or improving the efficiency of a vehicle or a turbine blade. Unfortunately, increasing efficiency can  result in a consequent increase in use - [Jevons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox). It is unlikely that improving efficiencies alone is really going to have much impact on our emissions. Instead, inefficient activities (flying for instance, except perhaps one day with dirigibles), need to have their supply massively limited.

### Accelerate the development of new products and processes

As a search process, optimation may also accelerate the search for materials such as for batteries or greenhouse gas removal compounds. Again, this is not to be sniffed at but these are specific carefully-designed applications of AI, which are quite different from the applications (usually generating text or images) to which the hope coda article alludes.

Thus, AI may allow us to understand how well or badly we are doing and gain us efficiency in transport, buildings and energy supply. But that leaves quite a few bullets in [the previous section](#how-do-we-solve-climate-change) untouched by AI.

## What can't AI solve?

Despite what the tech oligopoly would have us believe, AI is not being more creative than humans. Even the quirky outputs from some generative AIs are not truly original, they are simply samples from a distribution of loads of works from loads of people. AIs tend to interpolate well, where there are lots of examples in their training datasets, but extrapolation is usually dreadful. Thus, AI will not have some wild new insight that will convince corporates ignore their profit motive, governments to prioritise social over economic issues, and individuals to change their lifestyles such that we turn around our greenhouse gas emissions in the next few years.

The hope coda worries me because it reads as a lazy excuse to carry on AI-ing without any real thought about the consequences. At its best it draws attention to the climate crisis, but at its worst its just another form of greenwash and climate delayism that prevents real urgent climate action.
