Markets are the source of all ills in the capitalist world, right? This was my instinct before I started my [MPA](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/study/master-public-administration-mpa-innovation-public-policy-and-public-value). Coming from a background in environmental worrying and occasional campaigning, it certainly seemed that markets were the cause of the relentless attack on the natural world and on the best attributes of people and society. After an intensive term learning about economics, in fact, after a second term letting the first one settle, I've come to understand markets in a rather different light. My sense now is that markets are simply one expression of a fundamental characteristic of humanity and why they fail is a clue to why other aspects of our society are also not working.


Markets are often explained and justified using the counterfactual: if you don't have markets for the discovery, creation and allocation of goods ([Song & Simpson (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app5.249)) you have to have planning, i.e. the state. The example in this [BBC radio programme](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b00zm0hy) considers sandwich shops under a planned economy. Even the most publicly-minded government can struggle to meet their population's desires for sandwiches and may site shops in inappropriate locations and instruct them to produce the undesirable sandwiches at unattractive price. Markets, on the other hand, will iterate over the options until some equilibrium is achieved, that is the locations of shops, the choice of sandwiches and their price is optimised for the population and the sandwich shop owners.

But hold on, its markets or state or ... chaos? That's not what Nobel prizewinner [Elinor Ostrom demonstrated](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.3.641). Ostrom, using the (at the time) the novel approach of actually _observing_ real people operating in real communities, identified "polycentric governance" by which "common pool resources" - those goods that we need to share and take care of - are managed effectively by communities. There is no "tragedy of the commons" by which selfish individuals deplete the resource and exclude others. Instead, people discuss and find consensus, implement and enforce agreements, monitor and evaluate outcomes and cycle through these processes as conditions change. Its as if humans knew how to run their lives for thousands of years before we were blessed with the markets and the state. Certainly, sometimes this would fail, in which case the system would break down. Those that were successful, however, would remain and develop. As such these systems are evolutionary ([Kay & King, 2020, p 168](https://www.johnkay.com/2020/02/12/radical-uncertainty/)).

One of my most favourite books that I'll probably never read again because it required a fair amount of concentration is [The Enigma of Reason by Mercier and Sperber (2018)](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/183625/the-enigma-of-reason-by-hugo-mercier-and-dan-sperber/9780241957851). It discusses how humans actually reason, as opposed to how we think we reason. A striking aspect that I took away was how everything that we have created as a species arises from our collective intelligence. This intelligence manifests when we interact, expressing our different perspectives, often arriving at a common understanding. From this understanding we can not only cooperate over the management of resources but we produce novel ideas and creations. These are the ideas and creations that have precipitated intellectual and technological innovations and revolutions throughout our history (and prehistory). I love that this book implicitly (at least I don't think it said explicitly) explains that neurodiversity _is_ the human condition, we are nothing without our divergent brains.

Ostrom's polycentric governance requires Mercier and Sperber's interationist reasoning - through expression, argument and evaluation of ideas. Both are evolutionary, the latter probably more genetic, the former more cultural, but both expressions of a complexity of negotiation that seems to be quintessentially human. It seems to me that markets are a "thin" version of this. Markets enable a diversity of perspectives to be negotiated over and, when they work "correctly" a consensus - a price - that benefits all can (at least briefly) be arrived at. However, I think they are "thin" because, unlike polycentric governance, which demonstrably worked for thousands of years as a complete system, most markets are symplistic and exernalise much that they depend on. Markets demonstrably fail without external regulation, stabilisation and legitimisation* - which is where the state comes in. Possibly we could argue that markets could also evolve into a comprehensive self-regulating, -stabilising and -legitmising system, that would require respecifying the goals of the system to include a thriving human future. 

Markets are a recent emergence from the natural character of our species to interact from our differing perspectives in order to arrive at a (temporary) consensus. But they are incomplete because they exclude relevant perspectives - those relating to the exploitation of resources throughout the lifecycle of the good. It seems to me that so much of how we run society right now excludes this core aspect of humanity. Currently, democracy stifles our humanity, leaving the majority powerless to express how decisions impact their lives. Instead they shout into the voids of social media with icreasing anger and polarisation. Its time we brought humanity back into democracy ([I wrote an essay on participatory deliberative democracy last term](https://github.com/PenguinJunk/mpa-assignments/blob/main/public_participatory_deliberative_local_democracy.pdf)). Also, my own area, innovation, stifles its potential by being considered the lofty realm of devoted organisations such a universities and a few "entrepreneurs" (whatever they are). This misses out on the perspectives and insights from the majority of citizens who, now more than ever, are needed to solve our most pressing problems ([Cottam, 2018](https://www.hilarycottam.com/radical-help/), [Trischler _et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/14719037.2022.2062041)).

I want to explore much more how we bring humanity back into society from how we run our organisations to how we solve our social, nature and climate crises. Please do share your perspectives and arguements, it the best way for me to learn! 

* I've used [Song & Simpson (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app5.249)'s citation of [Rodrik, 2007](https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctvcm4jbh), to identify three of the four external mechanisms that markets require. The other is mechanism is the creation of the market itself.  








The economy too because worship of "the market" prevents the engagement of real people in the market - they are behonlden to the mono/oligopolists who do not negotiate but rather set prices, sell false narratives and influence our democracy and innovation systems so that   and keep iterating this to-ing and fro-ing of perspective, information and ideas, and markets are simply a rather thin expression of this, what other 'markets' are there and are they working to their fullest potential?


I have occasionally been irritated with statements like "I believe in the market", usually uttered on social media. But the markets we are talking about are not a thing of faith living  


 just seems so very deeply human. As such, markets are not some sacresant [thing] that capitalism creates but simply how the application of humanity to consumable goods. 

 - at least they are rich expressions of humanity.   It seems to me that markets are a thin version of 

** 'market failure', this is the failure in real terms which means that people or the natural world suffers 



What interesting about this approach to managing goods is that it has so much in common with 

Not tragedy of commons, no asymetry between the governors and governed 

So markets work well for the siting and stocking of sandwich shops. The trouble is, without incentives and enforcement, traders in some markets can benefit from agglomerating into larger entities. This reduces their costs and competition until they are controlling the market by setting prices and [driving out competition](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3086727.stm). The consequence is another planning system ([Galbraith, 1973]()), this time in the private sector, which is has no public purpose and instead aims to maximise the returns for a its owners.

They optimise a misspecified objective which is, let's say, quarterly profit, ignoring the externalities, ignoring all the problems that they cause for the rest of the world, and the fossil fuel industry has outwitted the human race. We have lost. I'm sorry. We have lost. Even though we all know what needs to be done, we have lost because they figured this out 50 years ago and have developed a strategy that has outwitted the rest of us'' Stuart Russell, 2021, BBC Reith Lecture

SongS2018: 
Markets have allocative, discovery and creative functions
Markets are not self‐creating, self‐regulating, self‐stabilising, or self‐legitimising (Rodrik, 2007). This requires incentive structures, enforcement mechanisms, institutions (formal and informal), and the state
