Markets are the source of all ills in the capitalist world, right? This was my instinct before I started my [MPA](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/study/master-public-administration-mpa-innovation-public-policy-and-public-value). Coming from a background in environmental worrying and occasional campaigning, it certainly seemed that markets were the cause of the relentless attack on the natural world and on the best attributes of people and society.

After an intensive term learning about economics, in fact, after a second term letting the first one settle, I've come to understand markets in a very different light. My sense now is that markets are simply one expression of a fundamental characteristics of humanity and I think there are several other [entities] that express the same [characteristic].

Markets are often explained and justified using the counterfactual: if you don't have markets you have to have planning. The example in this [BBC programme]() considers sandwich shops under a planned economy. Even the most publicly-minded government can struggle to meet the desires for sandwiches of their population and may site shops in inappropriate locations and instruct them to produce the undesirable sandwiches at unattractive price. Markets, on the other hand, will iterate over the options until some equilibrium is achieved, that is the locations of shops, the choice of sandwiches and their price is optimised for the population and the sandwich shop owners.

So markets work well for the siting and stocking of sandwich shops. The trouble is, without incentives and enforcement, traders in some markets can benefit from agglomerating into larger entities. This reduces their costs and competition until they are controlling the market by setting prices and [driving out competition](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3086727.stm). The consequence is another planning system ([Galbraith, 1973]()), this time in the private sector, which is has no public purpose and instead aims to maximise the returns for a its owners. 

>  ''... some people have written articles saying ... that corporations function as machines. They optimise a misspecified objective which is, let's say, quarterly profit, ignoring the externalities, ignoring all the problems that they cause for the rest of the world, and the fossil fuel industry has outwitted the human race. We have lost. I'm sorry. We have lost. Even though we all know what needs to be done, we have lost because they figured this out 50 years ago and have developed a strategy that has outwitted the rest of us'' Stuart Russell, 2021, BBC Reith Lecture

Markets have allocative, discovery and creative functions
Markets are not self‐creating, self‐regulating, self‐stabilising, or self‐legitimising (Rodrik, 2007). This requires incentive structures, enforcement mechanisms, institutions (formal and informal), and the state
