While [starting](IIPP0011-Assignment1-v1) [my previous post](IIPP0011-Assignment1-v4), I speculated about specifying MVPs for non-digital solutions. In an idle conversation with a colleague recently, I suggested that the approach being used for their department's latest reorganisation was much like past examples of over-scoped IT projects - [Complex Sprawling Disappointments (CSDs)](IIPP0011-Assignment1-v4). 

The current reorganisation arose from a frustration that the department was not creating enough new products. The approach to restructuring the department has been to try duplicate the structures applied in other organisations. However, after several months (many more than [U.S. Digital Services Playbook's](https://playbook.cio.gov/) "no longer than three months"), the reorganisation hasn't occurred, staff are uneasy (some have quit) and work is being impacted.

There is a sense of incongruity with this way of restructuring and the fact that "Agile" is identified as the chosen work culture throughout documentation created about the restructure. Therefore, it was with little satisfaction that I read in [Schwartz's Introduction to A Seat at the Table (2017)](https://itrevolution.com/product/a-seat-at-the-table/):

> "rhetoric that says, 'We need immediate cultural change so that we can become Agile!' ... is strangely non-Agile"

Instead, Schwartz recommends that we should "experiment and learn about how an Agile approach to IT works within the broader business context that is the enterprise". We should perhaps start with a Minimum Viable Team...

For my previous post post, I attempted to apply a _Minimum Viable Product_ (MVP) approach to writing. I did find that identifying what the whole 'product' (the post) should _do_ (the user story) did help me structure my writing and as a result it was relatively fast to produce. (That said, I did also spend many hours in the night thinking about the post before writing it.) This time, I am being a little more fluid but maintaining the transparency. At this moment in time, you may agree that this post does not serve a _whole user need_ and is instead a couple of vaguely related thoughts that are unlikely to encourage you to check back in a few weeks....
