I speculated earlier about specifying MVPs for non-digital solutions. In an idle conversation with a colleague recently I suggested that the approach being used for their department's latest reorganisation was much like past examples of over-scoped IT projects - those CSNs. The current reorganisation arose from a frustration that the department was not designing enough new products. The approach has been to take solutions applied in other organisations and try to mould our organisation along the same lines. However, after several months (many more than "no longer than three months"), the reorganisation hasn't occurred, staff are uneasy and work is being impacted.
