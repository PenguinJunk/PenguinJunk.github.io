With a system in mind, I have articulated my over-arching question as 
> "how, in Southampton, do we address the rise of fascism in an increasingly volatile world, and how do we address climate and nature breakdown in an increasingly divided society?"
(see [Systems Thinking in the previous weeknotes](../A-return-to-weeknotes/#systems-thinking)).

# Social capital

There is already a body of work, often in the form of case studies, around social capital and responses to crises. The assumption, that often plays out, is that having good social capital results in better outcomes for communities when they experience stress (e.g. [Wambura, 2024](#Wambura2024), [Ye & Aldrich, 2019](#YeA2019)). Yet there remain questions due to the nuances of different settings. For instance, Bennett et al. ([2015](#BennettCEF2015)) find that people with stronger formal networks (such as through work) appeared to be more protected from shocks and this was thought to be due to having access to a greater diversity of ideas (or perhaps other commodities) through the network. However, trust is lower in heterogeneous communities than it is in homogeneous communities, which can lead to poorer outcomes for community members ([Aldrich, 2011](#Aldrich2011)). 

This latter paper is particularly interesting and used a recognised typology of social capital:
+ bonding - connections between individuals such as through family and neighbours, often with low diversity across connections
+ bridging - connecttions between individuals and different groups, such as through work or interest organisations resulting in higher diversity across connections
+ linking - connections between individuals and others in a more powerful position, such as across explicit, formal or institutionalized power or authority gradients in society
The two findings that I think are valuable for further work are:
1. communities with a habit of organising together are much better at doing which when a crisis hits
2. whilst connections to networks supports the recovery of connected individuals, those who are less well connected can fair worse than if there were poor connections across society.
