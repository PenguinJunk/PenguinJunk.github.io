I'm probably somewhat addicted to education. In particular, to that feeling when a new idea knocks my old conceptions sideways. The feeling is like a kick of adrenalin, but with less sting.

This happened almost exactly two years ago when I was attending [AIUK 2021](https://www.conferencecast.tv/event-1857-aiuk-2021). [Mahlet (Milly) Zimeta](https://theodi.org/person/dr-mahlet-milly-zimeta/) of the Open Data Institute presented on [Decolonising the data](https://www.conferencecast.tv/talk-40011-aiuk-spotlight-talks-session-1). Her theme drew on some exceptional literature including [The Fragility of Goodness by Martha Nussbaum](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fragility-of-goodness/B212012979833A828690B9CA907A87BF), which uses Greek tragedy to examine the impact of luck on a person's moral status. The realisation of this being that circumstance can determine whether a person is 'good' or 'bad' and that these circumstances can be reversed, turning a hero quickly into a villain, in someone's eyes. 

I'd experienced a similar mental kick at another AI conference, many years before. In what had started as an idle conversation about centralised citizen identity systems, a delegate (I sadly cannot remeber who) pointed out that a benign system can lead to catastrophe. "That was what the Dutch thought, and then the Nazi's occupied", she said and then went on to explain how fastidious Dutch record keeping prior to Nazi occupation had enabled rapid persecution of Dutch Jews. The Netherlands had [a long history of rigorous civil registration for military conscription](https://www.dutchgenealogy.nl/civil-registration) and administrative records were "exceptionally comprehensive" (quotation by [James C. Scott in Seeing Like a State](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/james-c-scott-seeing-like-a-state), p78). Oof.

Both these mental sideswipes led to a growing unease at work about a commercial project that was attempting to map property boundaries in another part of the world. In my own country, I know that a property boundary is associated with physical concepts like fence and hedge, and legal concepts like planning permission and trespass. It is also associated with political concepts of agency and privacy, and cultural concepts of tolerance and sharing. However, what do I know of the physical, legal, political or cultural connotations of property boundary in another country? This illustrates the _Fragility of Good_ across borders. At very least the work should have been asking what are the consequences of providing (accurate or inaccurate)information about property boundaries, to an actor in a society with different physical, legal, political and cultural understanding. Much better would have been for the work to be undertaken by a group that represented the diversity of that society. Thankfully, that work has now ceased.

Good is fragile over both space and time but perhaps the bigger fragility is the 
In her talk*, Zimeta concludes with a discussion of the _Fragility of Power_, that we 

Fragile or not, power is critical in all of these cases. In her delightful naration of real life experiences... Eugene .. describes US case studies ... PetersW2018 does likewise for the case of the Dutch Municipal Personal Records Database

NIDS and Aadhar case studies?


From seeing like a state:
``The troubling features of high modernism derive ... from its claim to speak about the improvement of the human condition with the authority of scientific knowledge and its tendency to disallow for other competing sources of judgement''



PetersW2018 note that there are few barriers to errors entering the system but many for its correction. [Error has more power than omission in Scott2020].
