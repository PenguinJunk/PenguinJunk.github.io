I love learning. In particular, to that feeling when a new idea swipes my old conceptions sideways. The feeling is like a kick of adrenalin, but with less sting.


This happened almost exactly two years ago when I was attending [AIUK 2021](https://www.conferencecast.tv/event-1857-aiuk-2021). [Mahlet (Milly) Zimeta](https://theodi.org/person/dr-mahlet-milly-zimeta/) of the Open Data Institute presented on [Decolonising the data](https://www.conferencecast.tv/talk-40011-aiuk-spotlight-talks-session-1). Her insights into designing better data infrastructure drew on classical literature including [The Fragility of Goodness by Martha Nussbaum](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fragility-of-goodness/B212012979833A828690B9CA907A87BF), which uses Greek tragedy to examine the impact of luck on a person's moral status. The realisation of this being that circumstance can determine whether a person is 'good' or 'bad' and that these circumstances can be reversed, turning a hero into a villain, the blessed into the wretched. 

I'd experienced a similar mental swipe at another AI conference, many years before. In what had started as an idle conversation about citizen identity systems, a delegate (I sadly cannot remeber whom) pointed out that a benign system can lead to catastrophe. "That was what the Dutch thought, and then the Nazi's occupied", she said and then went on to explain how fastidious Dutch record-keeping prior to Nazi occupation had enabled the rapid persecution of Dutch Jews. The Netherlands had [a long history of rigorous civil registration for military conscription](https://www.dutchgenealogy.nl/civil-registration) and administrative records were "exceptionally comprehensive" (quotation by [James C. Scott in Seeing Like a State](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/james-c-scott-seeing-like-a-state), p78). Oof.

Both these mental sideswipes led to a growing unease at work about a commercial project that was attempting to map property boundaries in another part of the world. In my own country, I know that a property boundary is associated with physical concepts like fence and hedge, and legal concepts like planning permission and trespass. It is also associated with political concepts of agency and privacy, and cultural concepts of tolerance and sharing. However, what do I know of the physical, legal, political or cultural connotations of 'property boundary' in another country? This illustrates the _Fragility of Good_ across borders. At very least, the work should have been asking what are the consequences of providing (accurate or inaccurate) information about property boundaries, to an actor in a society with different physical, legal, political and cultural conceptions. Thankfully, that work has now ceased.

I am becoming increasingly aware of how tools and services designed for public 'good' can have 'bad' outcomes. Evidently, good is fragile over both time and space but perhaps the most consequential fragility arises from paucity of insight into the lives and luck of others. The stories told in both PetersW2018 and Eubanks2019 beautifully illustrate the discriminatory impact that systems designed for 'good' - from streamlining car registration and welfare payments to identifying the risk of child abuse - can devastate the lives of those they should be serving. These systems trap individuals and families in a "digital cage" (PetersW2018) or "digital poorhouse" (Eubanks2019), unable to rectify errors or inbuilt discrimination because the system designers did not imagine that such failings were possible or mattered. In this case, the border between 'good' and 'bad' is drawn through society. 

There are two approaches to dealing with fragile borders. The first is to fortify them. This is the purpose of legislation and regulation that defines what is 'good'. However, these are too often limited by the imagination of the small group of, often powerful, people creating them. This means that even the most socially-minded laws and regulations rarely keep up with developing technology or society. Like [the damage that continuing lack of data privacy](https://theswaddle.com/what-is-a-constant-lack-of-digital-privacy-doing-to-our-mental-health/) is causing to us all, too often people suffer indignity and abuse before statutary instruments are updated.

The other approach is to embrace fragility and seek to imagine its every outcome. With specific reference to poverty, Eubank proposes a gut-check:
* Does the tool increase the self-determination and agency of the poor?
* Would the tool be tolerated if it was targeted at non-poor people?

This is a simple step, but still somewhat externalises the experience of 'the poor'**. Zimeta takes us further by identifying that it is not just goodness that is fragile but also power. Public services tend to be designed by those with power and applied to those with none. They should therefore be designed as if power could be reversed at anytime. A different perspective on this is the [Maximin principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#:~:text=In%20philosophy%2C%20the,members%20of%20society%22) - the outcome of [John Rawls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls)'s thought experiment about the world that we'd create if we did not yet know our place in it. The principle is that society should maximise the welbeing of those at the most minimal level. Zimeta suggests that data infrastructure should be designed as if the rules of power could be reversed at any time.

However, none of us are blind to our place in the world and we cannot assume that designers of services have the imagination to fully apply gut-checks, maximin or acknowledge the _Fragility of Power_. We need to maximise the imagination of our service designers by ensuring they fully represent those who will be most impacted. In my property boundary example, a much better approach would have been for the work to be undertaken by a group that represented the diversity of that society. Public services must be designed by the public.

*If you have not seen [Zimeta's talk](https://www.conferencecast.tv/talk-40011-aiuk-spotlight-talks-session-1), please do. I will not have done it justice in this blog.

**I don't intend to be negative about Eubanks' book - not only is it a much deeper study than I convey in this post, it is also an extremely accessible read and thus itself obeys the maximin principle. 

discusses works looking at the impacts of reversal of power - rules could be reversed at any time

As I suggested in the boundary mapping example, such a stretch of imagination would surely be so much easier if those directly impacted by a new (device/technology/action - make sure this is consistent through this post) are involved in its creation. This must be the real lesson of the fragility of good, 

Fragile or not, power is critical in all of these cases. In her delightful naration of real life experiences... Eugene .. describes US case studies ... PetersW2018 does likewise for the case of the Dutch Municipal Personal Records Database

Eubanks2019 poverty is a borderland, there's quite a lot of movement in the economic fringes



 and the Maximin Principle from [John Rawls's A Theory of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice),

The lesson is stark: performing an act for a beneficial purpose can lead to catastrophic outcomes.)
